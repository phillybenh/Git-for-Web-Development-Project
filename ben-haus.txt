Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available. Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as the need to. You can use the display property in CSS to change this behavior though.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        'position: absolut' positions an element relative to it's nearest positioned ancestor element (and not the viewport).
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        "display: inline-block"!
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Blocky:
            1)<header>
            2)<blockquote>
            3)<div>
        Inline:
            1)<a>
            2)<button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
        The box model is a way of describing the space around an HTML element. From outside in it is Margin->Border->Padding->Content. I didn't know it was broken, but the 'box-sizing: border-box;' property has made life easier for me.
